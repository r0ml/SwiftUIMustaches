# SwiftUIMustaches

When I set out to write a Photo Editing Extension, all of the sample code I could find was targeting iOS 8 -- and therefore using UIKit.

I wanted to write such an extension using SwiftUI instead of UIKit.  As far as I know, there are no other examples of this.

This sample was inspired by [SwiftMustaches](https://github.com/elpassion/SwiftMustaches).  It sets out to do the same thing (deface photos with mustaches).  The implementation is completely different (Swift has changed a bit since iOS 8, and SwiftUI builds the UI differently than UIKit).  Many thanks to El Passion for the inspiration.

This sample shows how to use the Vision Framework with async/await instead of callbacks.

It will work on both MacOS and iOS.

The mustaches are not quite in the right place -- but then, this repo is mostly about being a sample for how to use SwiftUI to write a Photo Editing Extension.  I apologize for the shoddy positioning of the mustaches.
